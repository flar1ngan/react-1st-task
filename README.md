### Description

App.jsx returns a page (ArticlePage) that contains component similiar to MainBody that we created during session on 15.09.2022, it's called CountryArticle. Created component (ArticleElement) is basically full article that contains an image and some text about anything (problem: judging by file names it seems like it should be about countries, not really best component's name choice by me). What ArticleElement contains is described in CountryArticle.jsx. You can add multiple ArticleElement components in ContryArticle.
